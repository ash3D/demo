Detailed description of the following rendering techniques is in MSc thesis "Research and development of several rendering algorithms" which is available in Russian at http://www.cv.imm.uran.ru/labels/shaydurov-aleksey.
# SurfaceDetailVariations
Contains Parallax Occlusion Mapping technique extended with following features:
* reflections
* hybrid texture coordinate gradient computation method
* adaptive sample count selection

# LocalRayTracing
Hybrid reflection technique based on local raytracing in pixel shader for object selfreflections and cubemaps for environment reflections.
